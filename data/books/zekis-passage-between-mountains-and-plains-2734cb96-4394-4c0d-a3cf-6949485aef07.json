    "theme": "Zeki’s Passage: Between Mountains and Plains\n\nZeki was born in Erzincan, a place where mountains pressed so close it felt as though the sky itself was a secret. Winters were long, silent, and severe; summer brought orchards and the smell of apricots drying on rooftops. To a boy, Erzincan taught two lessons: endurance and patience. When the earth shook, as it sometimes did, walls cracked, dishes fell, and neighbors prayed aloud. Zeki came to believe early that nothing—stone, school, or even family—was entirely permanent.\n\nIn the 1970s, the political fever spread across Turkey like a dust storm. In Erzincan, the unrest felt distant at first—rumors whispered in the tea houses, news drifting in over shortwave radios. But when Zeki moved to Adana as a young man, the unrest became a daily thunder. Adana was hotter, louder, filled with factories and slogans painted on every wall. Walking to school there meant passing checkpoints, seeing students divided into left and right, sometimes fighting with knives or guns.\n\nZeki carried his notebooks tightly, as though geometry and literature could shield him from stray bullets. “Education is our only weapon,” his teacher once said. But the classroom often closed before the lesson could finish.\n\nOne evening, as Zeki returned home, he found his mother sitting in the courtyard, silent, staring at the apricot tree. His father spoke plainly:\n“We are raising you for life, not for martyrdom. This country has turned schools into trenches. We must go.”\n\nLeaving was not abandonment, Zeki realized later—it was an act of defiance against despair.\n\n⸻\n\nThe United States\n\nWhen they arrived in America, Zeki felt the strange paradox of exile: to lose one’s land but gain one’s time. Streets in Adana had been too loud for study, but in this new country the silence was sometimes unbearable. The loneliness of learning English was heavier than any political slogan. Still, he studied, because study was his rebellion, his survival.\n\nYears passed, and Zeki became a father. When his children asked about Turkey, he didn’t tell them only about the danger. He told them about Erzincan’s mountains that seemed eternal yet shook, and about Adana’s plains where slogans bloomed faster than crops.",
    "lesson": "The Lesson\n\nHis children pressed him: “Did you leave because you were afraid?”\nZeki shook his head.\n“No. I left because fear and courage are the same road. One end makes you pick up a gun. The other end makes you pick up your books and walk away.”\n\nThen he would add a final, unpredictable thought:\n“Never believe that moving saves you. Mountains crumble, plains burn, and even safe countries grow restless. What saves you is the decision, every day, to build something that cannot be destroyed by slogans or earthquakes. To carry a school inside yourself, wherever you go.”\n\nAnd so Zeki’s life carried a paradoxical truth: the boy who left Erzincan to escape unrest never truly escaped—it lived inside him, sharpening him into someone who knew that permanence is an illusion, and that freedom comes only when you realize every place is both home and exile.",

    "customTone": "The vibe of Zeki’s story is: \t•\tPhilosophical and weighty: It carries the sense that life is both fragile and resilient, where politics, geography, and fate collide but inner resolve keeps continuity. \t•\tBittersweet nostalgia: Erzincan’s mountains, Adana’s plains, and the decision to leave all echo longing, memory, and exile. \t•\tTension between permanence and impermanence: Earthquakes that shake mountains, unrest that shatters schools, and migration that remakes identity. \t•\tA universal exile’s wisdom: Though about Turkey and America, it is also about the condition of carrying “a school inside yourself.”  ⸻",

  "aestheticNotes": "Maintain a palette of muted earth tones, ochres, and faded blues, with fractured lines and ghostly overlays. Ensure mountains, apricot branches, and scattered pages reappear as motifs across settings. Use symbolic lighting: cold, bluish for Erzincan’s winters; harsh, sun-bleached for Adana; washed-out, ghostly whites for America. Characters—Zeki (slender, contemplative, always with a notebook or geological instrument), Denizcan (his son, modern, thoughtful)—should be visually consistent. Layer surreal elements (floating mountains, dissolving slogans, paper-apricot hybrids) to blend memory and present.",

      "narrative": "Zeki remembers childhood beneath Erzincan’s shadow, where the mountains crowded every horizon, their presence both shelter and quiet threat. Each winter, the snow pressed down, muffling the world, while inside, families waited for the earth’s next tremor. In the silence, Zeki’s fingers traced cracks spidering across plaster—reminders that nothing, not even stone, endured forever.\n\nHis earliest lessons came not from books, but from the rhythm of survival: how to balance patience against the anxiety of collapse, how to cherish the fleeting warmth of summer’s apricot harvest. It was here, in this cradle of uncertainty, that Zeki learned to measure time by what the earth gave and took away, and to see permanence as a fragile hope.",
      "illustrationPrompt": "Wide shot: Young Zeki stands in a small Erzincan courtyard, dwarfed by looming, blue-grey mountains. Earthquake cracks run up the walls, morphing into chalk geometry lines across the sky. Apricot trees shed both fruit and paper pages onto snowy ground. Lighting is cold, faintly bluish; keep Zeki’s features consistent for later.",

      "narrative": "Summertime in Erzincan arrived with the scent of drying apricots, their golden skins darkening on rooftops. Zeki learned to pit the fruit beside his mother, hands sticky, as elders spoke in hushed tones about old earthquakes and vanished villages. Patience was cultivated here, as the sun slowly coaxed sweetness from bitterness.\n\nIn the quiet, Zeki’s mind wandered to the geometry of the mountains, the way fault lines mapped invisible destinies. His mother would remind him, \"Patience is the only harvest that never fails.\" Zeki didn’t yet know what he was waiting for, only that something always threatened to change.",
      "illustrationPrompt": "Medium shot: Rooftop scene, Zeki and his mother pitting apricots on trays. Apricot halves and loose book pages intermix. In the background, mountains loom, their bases etched with white lines mimicking seismic faults. Lighting is golden, soft, with apricot-orange highlights. Zeki’s mother’s face is contemplative.",

      "narrative": "One night, a tremor shattered Erzincan’s silence. Walls groaned; dishes leapt from shelves. Zeki’s father pressed him close as the house rocked, murmuring prayers into the darkness. Morning revealed new cracks and neighbors sweeping up broken glass—each fracture another reminder that permanence was an illusion.\n\nYet, life resumed. The apricot trees bent but did not break. Zeki watched as his father repaired the wall, whitewash hiding evidence but not memory. He began to understand that survival was not in denial, but in knowing what to rebuild—and what to simply let go.",
      "illustrationPrompt": "Close-up: Zeki and his father huddle in a dimly lit room as the wall behind them cracks open, light streaming through.

Zeki listened as men argued softly over tea, words like 'revolution' and 'justice' floating above the steam. For now, unrest was an abstraction, distant as the city of Ankara.\n\nBut Zeki sensed a tension beneath the calm, a sense that even in these mountains, change was gathering force. He began to dream of places beyond Erzincan, where the earth’s shaking took different forms and the lessons of endurance might mean something new.",
      "illustrationPrompt": "Interior tea house: Men in shadowed corners, steam rising from glasses. A radio sits on a chipped table, emitting static. Zeki, slightly older, listens intently.
